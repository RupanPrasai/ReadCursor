    <h1>Basic Article Fixture</h1>

    <p id="p1">
      This is paragraph one. It exists to give the reader engine predictable text geometry and stable layout.
      We want enough words to make highlighting obvious and repeatable across runs.
    </p>

    <p id="p2">
      This is paragraph two. It should become a separate readable block. We will target this block for
      the start-from-here test by dispatching the readcursor:startHere event with its rcid and coordinates.
    </p>

    <p id="p3">
      Paragraph three includes <strong>inline elements</strong> and <em>mixed formatting</em> so extraction
      and word geometry have to handle nested nodes correctly.
    </p>

    <div class="spacer"></div>

    <p id="p4">
      Paragraph four is far down the page to test scrolling behavior and ensure the runtime doesn’t rely on
      initial viewport-only content.
